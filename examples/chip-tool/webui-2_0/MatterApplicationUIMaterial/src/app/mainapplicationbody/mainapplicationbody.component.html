    <h3>What is Matter?</h3>
    <p>Matter (formerly Project Connected Home over IP or Project CHIP) is an open-source application layer that aims at creating a unified communication standard across smart home devices, mobile applications, and cloud services. It supports a wide range of existing technologies, including Wi-Fi, Thread, and BluetoothÂ® LE, and uses IPv6-based transport protocols like TCP and UDP to ensure connectivity between different kinds of networks.</p>
    <p>The goal of the Matter project is to simplify development for manufacturers and increase compatibility for consumers. The project is built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.</p>
